# Archaeology Log

Standing record of the noon archaeology dig — every search angle tried, what it returned, and
what was rejected and why. The point of this file is that no future dig repeats an angle that
has already been worked dry. Read it before searching.

---

## 2026-08-05 — first run

**Result: 1 video found, vetted and fully ingested.** Well short of the target of 10. The
shortfall is real and is explained below; it is not for lack of angles worked.

### Headline finding: the ledgers are not a head start any more

The routine assumes the standing ledgers contain uningested candidates that are free finds.
As of today they do not.

- `KIRIAKOU-OPEN-VIDS.md` — 100 rows, **all already `ingested`**, 4 `skip`. Nothing to take.
- Pulled every videoId out of all six ledgers (`OPEN-VIDS`, `OPEN-VIDS-BATCH4`,
  `NEW-VIDS-2026-07-28`, `MASTER-LEDGER`, `UNIVERSE`, `SOURCE-DISCOVERY`) = **1,156 unique ids**.
  Diffed against corpus videoIds + `.kir-exclude.txt` + `.kir-intake-progress.tsv` (1,619 known)
  → **102 genuinely unresolved**. Probed all of them with yt-dlp for real channel, duration and
  upload date.
- Of those 102, **zero survived vetting.** Breakdown below.

### The re-cut farm problem (the main reason the pool is empty)

The unresolved ledger rows are dominated by channels that re-cut interviews already in the
corpus. I verified this rather than assuming it, because the ledger's own guess was wrong in
both directions.

Method: pull auto-captions, normalise to plain text, then measure (a) union 8-gram coverage
against the whole corpus and (b) contiguous verbatim runs against the single best-matching
corpus file.

**Calibration matters here and cost me an hour.** Union coverage alone is *not* discriminative:
a known-genuine interview (Theo Von #661) scores **60.7%** leave-one-out against the corpus,
because Kiriakou retells the same anecdotes in near-identical words. Anything that treats
~60% as proof of duplication will reject real material. The discriminator that actually works
is **long contiguous verbatim runs against one file, including the host's own speech**.

| Channel | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Covert Operations Insight (9) | **re-cut farm — reject** | 43iOYjANtcQ: 148 runs ≥25 words vs Theo Von #661, incl. host questions |
| Covert Strategies Revealed (27) | **re-cut farm — reject** | JBbwtTbC3hA: 65% union, concentrated on two prior interviews |
| **National Security Files (8)** | **re-cut farm — reject** | z4OWvuV3EYQ: 190 runs ≥25 words vs The Pocket / Chris Griffin, **including a verbatim podcast ad read** |
| The Insight Network, Rated R TV | reject | flagged re-upload channels; EQCTyoEjeMc has since been deleted by its uploader |
| Liberty Vault (2) | reject | not a Kiriakou channel (per BATCH4 ledger note) |

`KIRIAKOU-NEW-VIDS-2026-07-28.md` §F1 calls National Security Files *"REAL, and the best find"*.
**That is wrong** — it is a re-cut farm like F4 and F5. Corrected here so the next dig does not
spend the run on it.

### Corpus integrity issue found in passing (not fixed — flagging only)

**24 source files already in the corpus come from these farm channels**: Covert Operations
Insight ×10, Covert Strategies Revealed ×4, Liberty Vault ×7, National Security Files ×3. They
have been woven into articles and are cited there (e.g. `george-tenet.mdx` cites
`2026-06-02-covert-strategies-revealed-…` for the Tommy Franks/Tehran exchange). That means
some citations point at a re-cut aggregation rather than the original interview.

I did **not** touch them. Deleting them would break live citations and is well outside a
discovery run. This needs a dedicated provenance-repair pass: for each of the 24, find the
original interview, re-point the citation, then retire the farm copy.

### Angles worked today

| Angle | Queries | Yield |
|---|---|---|
| Ledger mining (all six ledgers) | — | 102 unresolved → **0 usable** |
| `tools/find-new-kiriakou-videos.mjs` baseline | fixed set, ≥40m | **1 hit — and it was a National Security Files re-cut.** The floor is dry. |
| Career-era: 2007 waterboarding, 2009 Zubaydah, 2012 plea, 2015 release, Reluctant Spy tour | 5 | 0 |
| Topic: Espionage Act, Assange extradition, torture-whistleblower-2013 | 3 | 0 |
| Co-guest: McGovern, Radack, Drake, Ellsberg, Hedges, Maté, Halper, Rowley, Husseini | 9 | 0 new Kiriakou — **this angle is a trap**: it returns the co-guest's own catalogue, not his. |
| Misspellings: "Kiriako", "Kyriakou" | 2 | 0 |
| Events/talks: Liberty Forum, keynote, university lecture, book talk, HOPE, Left Forum, film festival, bookstore, award | 20 | **the productive vein — 2 real finds** |
| Foreign/diaspora: Cyprus, Greece, Greek Orthodox | 3 | **the Cyprus find** |
| Internet Archive (`archive.org` advancedsearch, 120 hits) | 1 | 0 usable — dominated by RT *The Whistleblowers* TV captures (his own show, ~30m) |

Two sweeps of 20 queries × 25 results = **943 raw hits, ~420 unique ids new to the corpus**,
nearly all of which were other whistleblowers' content surfaced by the co-guest queries.

### Ingested (1)

| Show | Date | Len | videoId | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cyprus Diaspora Forum — *John Kiriakou Fireside Chat* | recorded **2026-05-08**, uploaded 2026-07-23 | 75m | `vCB56HbNvOo` | 3.2% union coverage — almost entirely new material |

Interviewed by Philip Amaman at the Amara Hotel, Limassol. Solo fireside chat, not a panel.

**Normaliser bug caught here — worth knowing about.** `normalize-vtt.mjs` stripped 12
consecutive paragraphs (30:16–36:05) as "sponsor reads". They were not ads: they were the
richest canon in the recording — the Nicosia green line, the lit crescent on the mountainside,
his refusal on principle to cross to the occupied side, the dinner with the Turkish deputy
foreign minister, and the Republican committee chairman on NATO Article 5. This is exactly the
over-stripping failure the playbook warns about. I restored all 12 paragraphs in timestamp
order and deleted the `.sponsors.md` sidecar. **Check the sidecar on every event recording** —
applause, music stings and audience Q&A appear to trip the ad heuristic.

### Rejected after fetching (worth recording so they are not re-fetched)

| videoId | What it was | Why rejected |
|---|---|---|
| `WF8NOMGWI2o` | "Piers Morgan & John Kiriakou Full Debate", 51m | **Five-way panel** (Piers, Scott Horton, Joe Kent, an Israeli guest, Jim). Kiriakou only enters at 13:24 and auto-captions carry no speaker labels — attribution unsafe under doctrine rule #4. Fetched, then removed and added to `.kir-exclude.txt`. |
| `jEamop1gJxw` | "A Fireside Conversation at Cyprus Diaspora Forum", 70m, World Affairs Podcast | Same conversation as `vCB56HbNvOo`, different uploader. Kept the forum's own longer cut. |
| `uxHODlAhiBk` | "John Kiriakou & Jay Dyer", 78m | **He is the host** — this is his own *Deep State* show posted to Dyer's channel. Low canon density. |
| `jOzI8j-dHKg` | "CIA Whistleblower Debates CIA Loyalist", 60m, *Best of* Danny Jones | Re-upload of `2024-08-12-danny-jones-loyal-officer-vs-dissident-spy`. |
| `P87hPOyEOfE` | Julian Dorey Daily, 61m | 154 verbatim runs ≥25w vs `2026-02-23-epstein-lies-satanic-elite-mossad` — re-cut. |
| `ftznt3LxoEI` | The Young Turks, 47m | Same conversation as the two 2026-07-10 TYT sources, re-posted 3 days later. |
| `0Q8vwrego9k` | NH Liberty Forum 2014, 94m | **Kiriakou is not in it** — zero mentions in the full transcript. Title matched, he did not. |
| `jcg5aO_H9OU` | American Whistleblower Tour, 89m, 2015 | Genuine and he is credited — **no captions**. → whisper queue. |
| `mriqX2_9Xp8`, `18pZGRe8F4U`, `hJEWVVtbB48`, `8SV3618tLAE`, `aFszjzDjbo8`, `VfDIZ0t4zt0`, `tO83oMvqKKE`, `RcB7b2FBgD0` | think-tank / conference panels | multi-guest panels — doctrine reject |

### Parked for whisper

- `jcg5aO_H9OU` — American Whistleblower Tour: Essential Voices for Accountability, 2015-03-31,
  89m, Edmond & Lily Safra Center. Genuine, credited, no auto-captions. Best remaining lead.

### Honest assessment of the shortfall

I reached 1 of 10. The angles in §2 of the routine are worked above, plus a round of invented
ones (Internet Archive; diaspora-forum and Greek/Cypriot event vocabulary; the verbatim-run
duplicate test used as a discovery filter rather than only a dedupe). The constraint is not
search effort — it is that **the 2024–2026 YouTube surface is saturated**, and what looks like
untapped supply in the ledgers is re-cut farm output that dedupes clean by videoId while being
duplicate by content.

Where the remaining supply actually is, for the next dig:

1. **Caption-less event recordings** — the whisper path. `jcg5aO_H9OU` is one; the GAP
   American Whistleblower Tour ran multiple campus stops, each likely its own recording.
2. **Panels, if the doctrine is revisited.** There is a real body of 2014–2017 conference
   material (HOPE X, FIFDH Genève, CovertAction events, Assange vigils) where he speaks
   substantively. All currently rejected on attribution grounds. A speaker-diarisation step
   would unlock this tier — worth raising, because it is the largest untapped block found today.
3. **Non-YouTube audio** — podcast RSS back-catalogues, radio archives, C-SPAN. Barely scratched;
   the Internet Archive pass today only covered its own index.

### Editorial output

New article: **Breaking the nuclear taboo** — Trump reportedly weighing a tactical nuclear
weapon in Iran to break the taboo so future presidents could use larger ones; the cabinet
objection; the General Caine nuclear-codes account and Caine's denial. Written from three
independent sources, not just today's.

Woven (all verified against timestamps before citing):

- `bill-richardson.mdx` — his own counter-ask (ambassador to Greece or Cyprus in the second
  term); Eric Holder as a third man promised State; six promised in total.
- `john-kerry.mdx` — Kerry telling the Obama Christmas-dinner story *on stage* at Brookings,
  off script, with Kiriakou reading along in the front row.
- `george-tenet.mdx` — Rice's *"George, you're just going to have to take one for the team"*;
  what the agency's actual WMD paper said. This exchange appears in 6 sources and was in **no**
  article.
- `cyprus-green-line.mdx` — the lit crescent, the refusal to cross, the 45-minute visit,
  Turkish Cypriots vs settlers, the Anatolian demographic point.
- `israel-turkey-nato-article-5.mdx` — the scenario put to a Republican committee chairman and
  his EU-military-alliance answer.
- `netanyahu-nuclear-threat-to-trump.mdx` — the 1986 start date, the sequence of refusals,
  Obama's *"go ahead, use them"*.
- `gulf-security-bargain.mdx` — August 1990 dating, the embassy's photographic history of the
  "special relationship", two ambassadors confirming it is lip service, *"crooked real estate
  agents"*.

## 2026-08-06 — the podcast-feed seam

**Headline: the ledgers were a head start after all — just not the part anyone had looked at.**

Yesterday's dig concluded the pool was empty after pulling **1,156 videoIds** out of the six
standing ledgers and finding 102 unresolved, none usable. That method had a blind spot: it
extracted `videoId`s and nothing else. Every **non-YouTube URL** sitting in those same files —
podcast RSS feeds, direct MP3s, Vimeo, C-SPAN — was invisible to it.

There were **197** of them. 160 were podcast feeds. Scanning those feeds for Kiriakou episodes
returned **168 episode hits, 111 of them ≥40 minutes**, and after dedupe against the corpus by
date + title overlap, **53 genuinely unresolved** — of which 18 passed vetting as full-length
solo interviews. Many have **no YouTube upload at all**; the audio→whisper path is the only way
in, which is exactly why a decade of YouTube-first sweeps never touched them.

### Angles worked

| Angle | What it returned |
|---|---|
| **Non-YouTube URLs in the ledgers** (new) | **The seam.** 197 URLs → 160 feeds → 168 Kiriakou episodes → 111 ≥40m → 53 unresolved → 18 vetted accepts. This is where the run's finds came from. |
| `find-new-kiriakou-videos.mjs` baseline | 147 videos across 6 searches, **0 new candidates**. The floor is still dry. |
| **In-channel search across all 302 corpus channels** (new) | 2,210 hits. Almost entirely his own shows (DeProgram, Deep Focus, Dead Drop, Briefing Room), re-upload farms, and multi-guest panels (Mario Nawfal, #Unity4J, Suzi 3D). **One genuine find: Fort Collins part 2** — the corpus had part 1 and not part 2. |
| Scott Horton's own archive (WP REST API, 53 results) | All 15 Kiriakou interviews **already in corpus**. His pre-2015 antiwar.com radio era did not migrate to the current site. Dead end, now documented. |
| **Apple/iTunes podcast-episode index** (new) | 99 episodes, **0 new**. Theo Von, Cleared Hot, Jeff Dornik, Dalton Fischer, Rogan #2392 all already held. The mainstream podcast surface is as saturated as YouTube. |
| Internet Archive (`advancedsearch`, 120 hits) | Same as yesterday — dominated by RT *The Whistleblowers* captures (his own show). 0 usable. |
| Era/misspelling/foreign-outlet sweep (20 queries × 20) | **0 new.** "Kiriakow", "Kyriakou", "Kirakou", Press TV, TRT, Al Mayadeen, teleSUR, CGTN, 2010 book tour, 2012 indictment, 2015 release — all dry. |
| Podchaser appearances index | **403 Forbidden.** Not scrapeable; unresolved. |
| YouTube fast-path for queued audio items | 13 targeted searches → **1 hit** (IRONCLAD = the Change Agents episode, with captions). Ingested via the fast path instead of whisper. |

### Correction to yesterday's log

`jcg5aO_H9OU` — "American Whistleblower Tour", parked yesterday as *"genuine, credited, no captions… best remaining lead"* — **does not contain Kiriakou.** I transcribed all 89 minutes to check. The panellists are Jesselyn Radack and Walt Tamosaitis; Kiriakou's name appears exactly twice, both inside Radack's introduction, where she is described as representing *"Edward Snowden and Thomas Drake as well as John Kiriakou."* He is a client being listed, not a speaker. Removed, added to `.kir-exclude.txt`. Same failure mode as `0Q8vwrego9k` yesterday: the title matched, the man did not.

### The ad-stripper is losing canon — found again, five times in one run

Yesterday's log flagged `normalize-vtt.mjs` over-stripping on one event recording. It is not an
edge case. **Five of this run's transcripts had real interview content filed as advertisements:**

| Source | Buried | What was in there |
|---|---|---|
| Sharyl Attkisson | **24 paragraphs** | His entire Assange background — Collateral Murder, the Swedish cases, the bugging of the Ecuadorian embassy, the plan to kidnap or kill him, Belmarsh. Exactly **one** line in the sidecar was a real ad (a body-butter read). |
| The Platform Talk | 12 paragraphs | The classic 12-paragraph fuse. |
| IRONCLAD | 22 paragraphs | 2 genuine ads correctly held back — the tool works when it runs. |
| U Cast (Venezuela) | 4 paragraphs | BRICS recourse, and his forecast that **Cuba falls next**. |
| U Cast (torture) | — | **The opposite failure:** two genuine radio ads (Moore Park College, a zoo light show) left sitting *in* the canon transcript, unstripped. |

`tools/unstrip-sponsors.mjs` fixed all four over-strips cleanly. The unstripped ads I left alone
under the non-lossy rule rather than hand-edit canon.

**There are 255 `.sponsors.md` sidecars in the corpus.** If the hit rate here is anything like
representative, a large amount of Kiriakou's testimony is sitting outside the canon corpus,
invisible to every article writer downstream. The Assange case is the proof: `julian-assange.mdx`
was 190 lines deep on the prosecution and had **never once mentioned Collateral Murder or
Belmarsh**, because the passage where he explains them had been filed as an ad read. A corpus-wide
`unstrip-sponsors --all` pass is the single highest-value job available right now. I did not run it
here — it is a large change and outside a discovery run's remit — but it should be its own routine.

### Ingested (10)

| # | Show | Date | Len | Path in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Kim Iversen — *Israel and Al-Qaeda* | 2026-04-02 | 68m | YouTube captions. Corpus held only a **12-minute clip** of this taping; this is the full episode. |
| 2 | Fort Collins Community Action Network — **Part 2** | 2016-04-26 | 50m | YouTube captions. Corpus had part 1 and not part 2. |
| 3 | Colonial Outcasts — *Renditions to El Salvador* | 2025-04-18 | 40m | Podcast feed → whisper |
| 4 | The Sharyl Attkisson Podcast #200 | 2023-10-13 | 40m | Podcast feed → whisper |
| 5 | The Platform Talk Podcast | 2021-03-24 | 66m | Podcast feed → whisper |
| 6 | IRONCLAD / Change Agents (Andy Stumpf) | 2025-09-03 | 41m | Captioned YouTube twin of a feed episode — fast path |
| 7 | U Cast Studios — *The CIA, Torture, And More* | 2024-12-19 | 43m | Podcast feed → whisper |
| 8 | Yung Flamingo Club | 2025-09-02 | 72m | Podcast feed → whisper |
| 9 | U Cast Studios — *Venezuela, the Maduro Trial* | 2026-02-05 | 50m | Podcast feed → whisper |
| 10 | Macro N Cheese — *Spelunking the Deep State* | 2023-01-07 | 60m | Podcast feed → whisper |

**Target met: 10 found, vetted, transcribed and written.** Eight of the ten came from the
podcast-feed seam and have no YouTube upload at all.

### Rejected after vetting

Julian Dorey Daily (all 16 rows — daily re-cuts of the main podcast, the farm yesterday
identified); Real Coffee with Scott Adams ×5 (his own show, Kiriakou only referenced); The Antedote
×3 (about RT and Russian media, not him); Piers Morgan Uncensored ×6 (panels — attribution unsafe);
Danny Jones #390 (guest is Julian Dorey); CODEPINK Radio ×3 and UK Column News (multi-topic
magazine shows); Politics and Prose (panel); Joannes Wyckmans ×4 (derivative/AI-summary feed);
con-sara-cy theories (commentary *about* his DOAC appearance); Valuetainment ×11 (all clips under
15m); plus same-conversation dups under different show names — WiseNuts, Ripple Effect ×2, Break It
Down, Potkaars, Jack Hopkins, Jack Neel, Doug Bopst, The Jason Jones Show, Fortress On A Hill Ep
133, London Real, Opperman Report, Austin and Matt #12.

### Whisper timing note, for whoever runs this next

faster-whisper `small`/int8 hit ~3× realtime with one worker. I started a second worker to
parallelise and **that was a mistake** — on 4 performance cores the two contended and each dropped
to ~1.3×, so combined throughput fell *below* a single worker. It got worse later when another
routine started competing for CPU (load average 12.7 on 8 cores). **Run one whisper worker, not
two**, and check `uptime` before assuming a stall.

### For the next dig — the head start

`KIRIAKOU-OPEN-VIDS.md` now carries **10 `queued` rows** (vetted, full-length, audio path ready) and
**5 `candidate` rows** (need vetting). Take the queued ones first; they are free finds. Beyond that,
the seam itself is not exhausted: this run scanned only the feeds *already named in the ledgers*.
Feeds nobody has ever written down remain untouched, and Podchaser's appearances index (403s to
plain fetch) is still unopened.

### Editorial output

**New articles (4)** — `bernie-sanders` (the Senate cafeteria, where Sanders held open breakfast
for anyone who walked in, against a senator who shoved a pregnant woman out of the cashier's line);
`proposals-to-relocate-the-palestinians` (the 1980s plan to rename a barren diamond on the
Saudi–Iraqi border "Palestine" — *"even insects don't live there"* — which lapsed when the two
governments settled the border); `israels-rightward-shift`; `cia-internal-social-culture` (his
one-word verdict, *"incestuous"*, and the club-for-everything structure behind it).

**Enriched (22)** — `julian-assange` (Collateral Murder, the Swedish cases, the bugged embassy,
Belmarsh — none of which the article had, because the passage had been filed as an ad read);
`fci-loretto` (the warden rejecting a book on CIA interrogation as *"disruptive"*);
`cia-recruitment-through-academia` (the Officer in Residence program, and that the professor-spotter
method by which he was recruited became illegal under the 1993 EEO Act); `zero-dark-thirty`
(Ellsberg telephoning two days before he went to prison — *"you're the only one with the moral
authority"* — and Mark Boal's reported regret); `cia-insiders-guide-to-surveillance` (the
surveillance-detection instructor who never noticed three years of FBI surveillance: *"I never
bothered to look, because I hadn't done anything wrong"*); `presidents-daily-brief` (the blue-border
and black-border reports, and *"isn't it great to be one of us now?"*); `once-cia-always-cia` (the
leave-without-pay year that is the whole factual basis of the slogan); `ron-wyden`
(*"it took all of my energy just to not lose my security clearance"* → *"even the overseers are
afraid of them"*); `george-tenet` (who persuaded him, and that they still believe they were right);
`alexander-acosta`; `extraordinary-rendition`; `expanding-the-definition-of-terrorism` (the CIA's
own working definition); `trump-cartel-terrorist-designation`; `bashar-al-assad` (the 2004 border
understanding); `sanctions-effectiveness`; `operation-paperclip`; `israel-united-states-relations`;
`venezuela-regime-change-2026` (Cuba next); `kiriakou-transfer-to-operations` (*"you are always
going to be the good cop"*).

## 2026-08-07 — platforms, the widened-feed seam, and the show-name dedupe trap

**Result: 12 new sources transcribed into the corpus; 10 of them written into the encyclopedia.**
Target met, but only just, and the attrition is the story: of 21 items that entered the day as
live candidates, **7 were duplicates of material already in the corpus** and none of them
deduped by videoId, by show name, or by title.

### Headline: the dedupe every previous dig has been getting wrong

Vet by **date + duration** against `ls src/content/sources/` FIRST, and only then by name.
Two distinct failure modes, both of which passed silently through yesterday's vetting:

1. **One taping, two show names (same network).** The Ironclad network publishes the same
   recording under multiple brands. `Borderland: Narcosis` 2025-04-07 (61m) *is*
   `2025-04-07-ironclad`; `Change Agents with Andy Stumpf` 2025-05-28 (61m) *is*
   `2025-05-28-ironclad-hidden-terror-program`. Both were queued yesterday as fresh finds.
2. **The feed carries the SHOW name; the corpus carries the HOST name.** `Dream Out Loud` #363
   is corpus `2026-05-05-morgan-nelson-cia-whistleblower` — same date, identical title.
   `Straight Talk with Mark Bouris` is corpus `2026-03-25-mark-bouris-…`. Grepping `show:`
   across the corpus finds neither, because the corpus never recorded the show name.

I caught the first one only by accident, at the editorial stage, after paying the full whisper
cost — the article I was about to weave into already cited `2025-04-07-ironclad`.

### Angles worked

| Angle | Status | Yield |
|---|---|---|
| Ledger head start (10 `queued` + 5 `candidate` rows from 2026-08-06) | worked | **4 dups, 1 wrong-guest reject**; the rest ingested |
| `find-new-kiriakou-videos.mjs` baseline | worked | 149 videos, 6 searches, **0 new candidates**. Third consecutive dry run — the floor is dead. |
| **Corpus transcript mining for show/host names** (new) | worked | Grepped all 1,110 sources for `on the X show/podcast`. Almost pure noise — he *references* Maddow, O'Reilly, Rogan and Tucker far more often than he reports his own bookings. The one lead (Dr. Phil) was already held 13 times over. **Low-yield; do not re-run.** |
| **Rumble** (platform never opened) | worked | 321 results / 305 Kiriakou-titled over 3 queries × 5 pages. **Rumble is a mirror layer, not a source** — Tucker, Rogan, Dorey, DeProgram and Deep Focus re-uploads plus re-upload farms (TheWarAgainstYou, Free Your Mind, crashingthunder, Truths Unlimited, Goodstuf, pepperpeep). Three Rumble-*native* shows found; one ingested. |
| **C-SPAN** (never opened) | worked | **The find of the day.** 5 results, of which `After Words with John Kiriakou`, 2010-04-23, 61m — Book TV's one-on-one author programme from the *Reluctant Spy* tour, interviewed by **Frederick Hitz, the CIA's own former Inspector General**. In no ledger. Also surfaced `Law and Morality of Interrogation` (2008-10-30), a **pre-whistleblowing** appearance — panel, so doctrine-rejected, but worth knowing it exists. |
| **Odysee / LBRY** (never opened) | worked | 30 results via the `claim_search` JSON-RPC. RT re-uploads of his own show, Next News Network clips, a Portuguese dub, Cleared Hot and Dorey re-uploads. **0 new.** |
| **Dailymotion** (never opened) | worked | 30 results, 3 over 40m. The one lead — Insider's 279m *"How 6 Secretive Government Roles Actually Work"* — is a six-person compilation. **0 new.** |
| **Vimeo** (never opened) | attempted | Search is JS-rendered; plain fetch returns nothing. **Unresolved, not dead** — needs a browser or the API. |
| **Widened podcast-feed seam** (new — the productive one) | worked | Yesterday scanned the 160 feeds *named in the ledgers*; that well is now dry. This searched the iTunes directory **by topic instead of by his name** — 32 topical terms → ~1,000 feeds, most never written down anywhere → **285 Kiriakou episode hits**. After stripping his own shows (DeProgram 187, Dead Drop 46) and Scott Horton (13, all held), **8 shows the corpus had never held**; 5 ingested today, 2 turned out to be host-name dups, 1 doctrine-rejected. |

### The successor to yesterday's seam

Yesterday's insight was "the ledgers contain non-YouTube URLs nobody looked at." That is now
exhausted. The generalisation with water still in it: **search the podcast directory by topic,
not by his name.** He is booked as the expert voice on CIA/torture/whistleblowing/foreign policy,
so the shows that had him are reachable from the subject matter even when his name never lands in
an indexed title. Terms that produced the new shows: *whistleblower, civil liberties, press
freedom, declassified, war on terror, counterterrorism*. Terms that produced only noise: *empire,
dissident, geopolitics, conspiracy realist*.

### Two transcription bugs found, one of them corpus-wide

**1. The ad-stripper is burying canon at scale — now measured.** Every previous log flagged this
qualitatively. `unstrip-sponsors.mjs --all --dry-run` puts a number on it:

> **236 files, 3,332 paragraphs of real interview content sitting in `.sponsors.md` sidecars,
> against 284 genuine ads.** The stripper is wrong roughly twelve times out of thirteen.

Today's intake alone had over-strips of 46, 31, 25, 24, 16, 12, 12, 12 and 11 paragraphs. The
46-paragraph case (Lehto Files) was 39% of the episode. I unstripped every file I ingested today
and left the rest alone — a 236-file mechanical change does not belong inside a discovery run's
single commit, and the last two runs reached the same conclusion. **It should be its own routine,
and it is now the highest-value job in the repo.** A ready-made priority ranking: scan sources for
timestamp gaps > 90s; the 12-paragraph fuse produces a distinctive ~400s hole. Worst offenders:
`dead-drop-s2e5` (+55), `deprogram-show-with-ted-ra` (+55), `jason-jones-3-hours` (+49),
`danny-jones-whats-really-happening-in-israel` (+48), `useful-idiots-halper-mat` (+41).

**2. `whisper2vtt.py`'s VAD filter destroys phone-line guest audio.** *Tell Somebody* (2015)
came back with the host's questions clean and Kiriakou's answers shredded — 9 gaps over 60
seconds, the largest 475s, roughly 20 of 56 minutes missing. It is a telephone interview and the
guest's level trips `vad_filter=True`. Measured on an identical 3-minute slice:

> `vad_filter=True` → 5 segments, **58 words**. `vad_filter=False` → 40 segments, **424 words**.

A 7× recovery. I re-transcribed that episode with VAD off and `condition_on_previous_text=False`
rather than change the shared tool mid-run, but **the default should be revisited**: the
asymmetry is the same one `unstrip-sponsors.mjs` documents — over-recovering silence is cosmetic,
losing testimony is a correctness bug.

`Abe Lincoln's Top Hat` #572 (2021-09-25, 92m) and `Seymizzle` (2025-10-16, 124m). Both are
genuine, correctly vetted, full-length interviews; both are pure retellings. Every distinctive
element I checked — the Japanese-diplomat sting, the Brennan→Holder letters, the plea ladder from
45 years down to 2.5, Plato Cacheris's *"you stupid son of a bitch, take the deal"*, "it's not
about justice, it's about mitigating damage", the honey-salesman intercepts — is already in the
articles, usually from three or more sources. They stay in the corpus as citation depth. **They do
not count toward the 10**, and padding the number with them would have been dishonest.

### Rejected (10)

### Parked

- **Tell Somebody 2015-05-21 (58m)** — genuine, and from the four-months-after-release period that
  is thin in the corpus. First transcription was unusable (see the VAD bug above); re-transcribed
  with VAD off at the end of this run.
- **AM WakeUp 2023-07-06 (191m, Rumble-native)** and **Health Ranger Report 2026-02-11 (111m,
  Rumble-native)** — both real, both deferred on format risk (3-hour livestream; multi-topic
  magazine show). In `KIRIAKOU-OPEN-VIDS.md` as candidates.
- **Potkaars New Year's Eve 2020-01-01 (144m)** — carried over again on length/format risk.

### Note for whoever reads the git history

A **second routine was committing to this branch concurrently** (commit `522f142d`, 18:33 UTC,
"Weaving pass 2026-08-07"). It swept up eight of this run's article edits along with its own work.
Nothing was lost, but this run's changes are split across two commits and the tree also carries
eleven untracked article drafts belonging to that other routine, which I did not stage or touch.

### For the next dig — the head start

`KIRIAKOU-OPEN-VIDS.md` carries fresh `candidate` rows from the widened-feed seam plus the two
deferred Rumble-native shows. Beyond that, the untouched ground is: **C-SPAN's full catalogue**
(only the `kiriakou` keyword was searched today — his colleagues' event recordings are unsearched),
**Vimeo** (needs a browser), **Podchaser's appearances index** (still 403s), and the widened-feed
method run against a second directory (Podcast Index or Listen Notes) rather than iTunes alone.

---

## 2026-08-09 — Mixcloud as an index, and chasing one interviewer through his own feed

**Result: 7 new sources found, vetted, transcribed and written into the encyclopedia — 11 new
articles and 51 woven revisions.** Short of the target of 10. The shortfall was **throughput,
not a dry well**: more vetted candidates were queued at the end of the run than at the start,
and four of the day's hours went to three separate silent failures in the shared transcription
tool. Every one of those is now fixed or documented below.

### Headline 1: Mixcloud is the radio-archive layer, and it is a discovery index only

No previous dig had opened Mixcloud. It holds the layer that YouTube and the podcast
directories both miss — terrestrial and internet **radio** archives, uploaded by the stations
themselves. Eight queries returned 13 Kiriakou items of 38 minutes or longer, across shows the
corpus had never held: *The Sharin' Hour* (KX93.5, Laguna Beach), *Homebrewed Culture Cast*,
*Loud & Clear*, the *Peter B. Collins Show*, *Epic Real Estate*, plus known ones (*Tell
Somebody*, *Scheer Intelligence*, *Challenging Opinions*, *Act Out!*).

**Its audio is deliberately protected against downloading and must not be taken from there.**
yt-dlp's Mixcloud extractor 404s, and the stream URL is obfuscated behind an anti-download
measure. So the method is: **use Mixcloud to learn which shows had him, then resolve each show
to its real podcast feed and pull the audio from there.** That worked for Sharin' Hour
(→ Spreaker), Homebrewed (→ FeedBurner/libsyn), Peter B. Collins (→ peterbcollins.com) and Epic
Real Estate (→ libsyn). It failed only for *Loud & Clear*, which has no surviving feed — see
the head start below.

### Headline 2: chase the interviewer through his own feed — Scheer alone was worth five

The single most productive angle of the day, and it generalises. **Robert Scheer's *Scheer
Intelligence* feed carries twelve Kiriakou episodes going back to 2015. The corpus held four.**
Five were ingested today; the rest are queued below. Previous digs chased *co-guests* (a trap —
it returns the co-guest's catalogue) and chased shows by name. This is different: take every
host who has had him more than once, find that host's own feed, and enumerate. Scheer had him
back roughly annually for a decade and the corpus had a quarter of it.

The corpus filing convention is what hid them: Scheer episodes are filed under **ScheerPost**
and under their **YouTube upload date**, so `2022-05-19-scheerpost` is in fact the interview of
**10 September 2021**. Grepping show names or dates finds nothing. Only the feed does.

### Angles worked

| Angle | Status | Yield |
|---|---|---|
| Ledger head start (3 `candidate` rows from 2026-08-07) | worked | Potkaars parked (transcriber hung); the two Rumble-native rows never reached |
| `find-new-kiriakou-videos.mjs` baseline | worked | 152 videos, 6 searches, **0 new. Fifth consecutive dry run.** |
| **Mixcloud** (platform never opened) | worked | **The discovery seam** — 13 items ≥38m, 5 shows the corpus had never held |
| **General web search** (method never used — every prior dig used platform APIs only) | worked | Found the Dissidentklubben Stockholm conversation, Alternative Radio's speaker archive, and johnkiriakou.com's media index. **Cheap and productive; run it every time.** |
| **Scheer Intelligence feed enumeration** | worked | **12 episodes vs 4 held — five ingested** |
| iTunes topical sweep, round 2 (26 fresh terms → 857 feeds) | worked | 124 Kiriakou episode rows, almost all already held. The residue that mattered was the Scheer feed. Diminishing returns on this method. |
| **fyyd.de** podcast directory (never opened) | worked | 9 hits, **0 new** — German-centric index, holds only Theo Von / Cleared Hot / re-cuts. **Dead end, do not re-run.** |
| **Spreaker search API** (never opened) | worked | Returns nothing for any Kiriakou query. **Dead end.** |
| **Audioboom API** (never opened) | worked | Ignores the query and returns the global recent firehose. **Dead end.** |
| **BitChute** (never opened) | worked | Re-upload farms only — WatchmanFT, TheWarAgainstYou (already flagged 08-07). **A mirror layer like Rumble.** |
| YouTube fast path (8 new query angles × 20 results) | worked | **0 new.** The curated "John Kiriakou Podcasts" playlist and the Dissidentklubben channel also yielded nothing beyond the one item already found. The YouTube surface is genuinely saturated. |
| ListenNotes | worked | Surfaced the Cyprus dup and the End Time America lead; no clean finds |
| Vimeo | attempted | Three items exist per web search; yt-dlp gets HTTP 401 on Vimeo's API. **Still unresolved — needs a browser.** |
| C-SPAN person page | attempted | 403 to a plain fetch. **Still unresolved.** |
| Alternative Radio | worked | Exactly one programme — *The War on Whistleblowers*, recorded **2016-02-13**, product KIRJ001. Paywalled; not obtainable. Recorded so nobody hunts it twice. |

### Three silent failures in the shared transcription tool

All three produce a file that looks fine. This is the important part of today's log.

**1. `vad_filter=True` deleted the guest's entire half of a phone interview.** The 2016 Sharin'
Hour came back as 2,944 words of the host talking to nobody — every one of Kiriakou's answers
gone, the questions clean. With VAD off: **10,115 words**. It is a telephone interview, and the
guest's level trips the filter. This is the **second** confirmed instance after the 08-07 *Tell
Somebody* case, and it is now clear the first was not a one-off.

**2. The same default stopped 22 seconds into a 65-minute episode** (Epic Real Estate) and
exited reporting success — 5 cues written.

**3. It hangs.** On the 144-minute Potkaars episode it ran **four hours**, emitted nothing after
minute 49, and was still burning 340% CPU when killed — a faster-whisper repetition loop that
never returns. This alone cost the run its margin.

**The fix, used for every source after the first two:** decode once with ffmpeg, cut into
ten-minute windows, and transcribe each window **in a separate process with a hard timeout**.
Windowing alone does not solve (3) — the loop happens *inside* a window, so only a killable
child process helps. The covered fraction is printed at the end, so truncation can never pass
silently again. Every source below reports 99% coverage.

**A fourth failure was mine, and is worth generalising:** when ffmpeg failed to decode the
Homebrewed MP3, my driver normalised the **previous item's** leftover transcript under the
Homebrewed filename. It was caught only because the word count and end timestamp matched a file
deleted minutes earlier. **Any intake driver must clear its working transcript between items.**

### The ad-stripper, again

Unchanged and still wrong in the same direction. Epic Real Estate: **12 paragraphs of canon
recovered against 1 genuine ad** — including the Las Vegas shooting, Ken Dilanian sending NBC
copy to the CIA for clearance before his own editor, and the leaked Yemen F-18 footage. Daniel
Hale: 7 paragraphs recovered, 0 ads. Every source ingested today was unstripped. The standing
recommendation from 08-07 — that a dedicated unstrip routine is the highest-value job in the
repo — is unchanged and now three digs old.

### Ingested and written (7)

| # | Show | Date | Len | Path in | What it added |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Dissidentklubben**, Stockholm | 2026-07-28 | 39m | YouTube captions | The CIA "owns something like 40% of Palantir" after Tenet's legal waiver; RFK Jr's account of his father asking McCone *"tell me your people didn't do this"*; the Intercept outing five whistleblowers |
| 2 | **The Sharin' Hour**, KX93.5 | 2016-01-12 | 60m | Mixcloud → Spreaker → whisper | **A corpus-empty year.** The Richard Welch killing in full; how 17 November was broken in 2002; the Taliban embassy phone bills; the Carlos the Jackal dentist capture; the entrance exams |
| 3 | **Scheer Intelligence** | 2015-12-11 | 38m | Scheer feed | Deuce Martinez and the business card; the charge built on information declassified to bring it; Eric Holder at Barbra Streisand's dinner table; *"I'm a non-person"* |
| 4 | **Scheer Intelligence** | 2022-04-01 | 44m | Scheer feed | Brennan asking DOJ to reopen the case secretly; three years of undisclosed surveillance; his then-wife reporting his legal strategy to the Office of Security; the 45-year opening offer |
| 5 | **Scheer Intelligence** — Daniel Hale | 2021-10-29 | 44m | Scheer feed | The roadblock strike and the dumpster; 40% of drone deaths civilian; the CMU conditions; the al-Qaeda prisoners protecting Hale from the skinheads |
| 6 | **Scheer Intelligence** | 2021-05-21 | 57m | Scheer feed | The 189 undeclared Israeli officers and the CIA headquarters ban; "Arabists"; the Kuwaiti royal's *"there will be no Palestinians in it"*; a **second, different account** of the conduct he was charged over |
| 7 | **Scheer Intelligence** | 2024-03-29 | 45m | Scheer feed | The August 2022 custody hearing in full — his own testimony that she was *"an amazing wife"*, then her answer that the Office of Security sent her to the ABC interview; the LA Times Iran call he could not explain for fourteen years |

**New articles (11):** `active-measures`, `stansfield-turner`, `cia-entrance-exams`,
`cia-divorce-rate`, `deuce-martinez`, `kiriakou-non-person`, `abu-zubaydah-cremation-footnote`,
`the-roadblock-drone-strike`, `the-189-undeclared-officers`, `arabists`,
`the-la-times-iran-op-ed`. **51 woven revisions** across the corpus.

**One variance deliberately preserved rather than smoothed:** in 2015 he traces his prosecution
to scanning Deuce Martinez's business card for Scott Shane; in 2021 he traces it to confirming a
surname to an ABC reporter writing a book on the Abu Omar rendition. Both are now recorded in
`deuce-martinez`, marked as differing accounts.

### Rejected (5) — and every one of them survived dedupe by videoId, show and title

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| **Sharin' Hour 2016-08-02 (60m)** | **89.6% shingle overlap with 2016-01-12 — the same taping re-aired seven months later.** Identical stated duration. Only `dupe-check.mjs` caught it |
| **Epic Real Estate 2026-02-10 (64m)** | 73% overlap with corpus `2026-02-09-epic-real-estate`; the podcast feed release lags the YouTube upload by a day. Same trap as SaltCube on 08-06 |
| **Peter B. Collins 2021-04-15 (56m)** | Two-guest interview — Kiriakou **and Joseph Hickman** on their joint book — with no speaker labels in the transcript. Attribution unsafe under doctrine rule 4; removed from the corpus rather than left as a trap for a future writer |
| **Scheer Intelligence 2023-12-15 (40m)** | **Kiriakou is not in it.** Guests are Kate Stonehill (*Phantom Parrot*) and Mohammed Rabbani of CAGE; his name appears **once** in the hour, spoken by the host. My feed resolver matched on a description mentioning him. **Fourth instance of this failure mode.** Reading the transcript before writing is the only guard |
| **End Time America 2026-07-28 (65m)** | Prophecy-commentary show, Kiriakou presence unverified. Dropped unvetted after the 2023-12-15 false positive rather than spend an hour finding out |

### Parked

- **Potkaars New Year's Eve 2020-01-01 (144m)** — the transcriber hang. Third dig running.
- **Loud & Clear 2016-01-29 (55m), 2016-08-29 (51m), 2017-01-19 (53m)** — all three are
  **guest-era** episodes and therefore doctrine-clean: Kiriakou did not become Brian Becker's
  co-host until **August 2017**. No podcast feed survives (Sputnik was delisted) and Mixcloud is
  the only archive, so there is currently no permitted route to the audio. Recorded so the next
  dig does not re-derive this.

### For the next dig — the head start

The queue is *longer* than it was this morning. In rough order of expected value:

1. **Finish Scheer.** Two known Kiriakou episodes remain: 2018-04-06 *The Wrong Direction for
   the CIA* (33m), 2022-05-20 *It's scoundrel time in the good ol' USA* (52m), 2024-03-29 *It's a
   secret only when Uncle Sam says it is* (45m). All three defeated `rss-pick.py`'s title
   matching — the titles begin with a curly apostrophe and score below its 0.55 similarity
   guard. **Resolve by feed index or GUID rather than title.**
2. **Apply the Scheer method to every other repeat interviewer.** Katie Halper, Kevin Gosztola,
   Garland Nixon, Danny Jones, Jimmy Dore, Dialogue Works, American Exception — each has a feed;
   enumerate it and diff against the corpus by *date*, not name.
3. **Homebrewed Culture Cast 2017-12-12 (79m)** — genuine, resolved, but ffmpeg fails to decode
   the libsyn MP3 (exit 183). Needs a re-encode or a different fetch.
4. **Rumble: AM WakeUp 2023-07-06 (191m), Health Ranger Report 2026-02-11 (111m)** — vetted as
   candidates on 08-07, still never reached.
5. Vimeo (needs a browser), C-SPAN's person page (403s), Alternative Radio KIRJ001 (paywalled).

**Method note for whoever runs this next:** the discovery half of the job is not the bottleneck
any more and has not been for three digs. Transcription is. A dig that spends its first hour
building the queue and its remaining hours transcribing will beat one that keeps searching.

## 2026-08-12 — SoundCloud, Apple's episode index, and a ledger that lied

### Headline 1: the standing ledgers are now actively misleading — dedupe against the corpus

The 08-09 head start listed five items as open. **Three of them were already in the corpus**:
both remaining *Scheer Intelligence* episodes (ingested 2026-08-10) and both Rumble-native rows
(ingested 2026-08-11). They were taken by the **corpus-mining and source-squeeze routines**,
which ingest sources but never touch `KIRIAKOU-OPEN-VIDS.md` or `ARCHAEOLOGY-LOG.md`.

Worse, two of the three were *not on disk* when this dig started — the EOS_DIGITAL volume had
dropped the files while leaving them intact in git. `ls` said absent, `ingest-audio-url.sh`'s
`-e` guard said absent, so the dig re-fetched and re-transcribed all three. The transcripts came
back **byte-identical** to the committed versions (faster-whisper's greedy decode is
deterministic), which is the only reason it was caught: `git status` reported the tree clean
after writing three "new" files.

**The rule that follows:** the exclusion set is `src/content/sources/`, matched on **show + date**
— never the ledgers, and never `ls` alone on this volume. Build the index first
(`date \t show \t title` from every source's frontmatter) and diff candidates against *that*.
This cost the dig roughly an hour and three wasted transcriptions.

### Headline 2: SoundCloud is the seam Mixcloud only half-covers — and its audio is fetchable

No previous dig had opened SoundCloud. It carries the same terrestrial-radio layer that made
Mixcloud valuable on 08-09, but with a decisive difference: **yt-dlp downloads SoundCloud audio
normally**, where Mixcloud resolves metadata and then 404s the stream. Mixcloud is an index;
SoundCloud is an index *and* a source.

Eighteen queries (`scsearch`, name variants plus topic terms) returned 160 unique items, 44 of
them 40 minutes or longer. Most were already held or were false positives matching on
description text — but it produced *This Is Hell!*, *Kate Dalley Radio* and WORT-FM's
*A Public Affair*, three shows the corpus had never held, in three thin years (2016, 2017, 2015).

A caution learned here: SoundCloud search matches **descriptions and tags, not just titles**. A
title-only grep would have dropped *A Public Affair* and *This Is Hell!*; it also let in *Pardon
The Dissent*, where the host merely plays a Kiriakou clip. Filter on duration first, then read
the description before queueing.

### Headline 3: Apple's `entity=podcastEpisode` is a different index from the feed sweeps

The 08-06 and 08-09 digs swept iTunes for **feeds** by topic and concluded the method had hit
diminishing returns. That conclusion was about the wrong endpoint. `entity=podcastEpisode`
searches **episodes directly**, so it finds shows whose feed-level metadata never mentions
Kiriakou — which is most of them, because a show's description describes the show, not its
guests.

Five queries returned 159 distinct episodes; after a diff against the corpus index, **six were
genuinely new and 40+ minutes**, including a 92-minute *Useful Idiots* from
2019 (the corpus held that show only from 2023) and a 64-minute *Sound Health Options* from
2017. It also surfaced roughly a dozen 2025–2026 shows absent from the corpus entirely, which is
a finding about the **7am intake**, not about archaeology: the daily routine is missing whole
podcast feeds. Those are parked as candidates rather than taken today.

**Two dedupe traps this endpoint sets.** Feed release dates and recording dates diverge — the
David Gornoski episode is dated 2020-09-22 in the feed and `10-15-19` in its own filename. And
the corpus files some shows under their **re-upload** date: *Reality Asserts Itself* Pt. 1 was
recorded 2019 and is held under 2023-04-24, so a date-window diff calls it new when it is not.

### Angles worked

| Angle | Status | Yield |
|---|---|---|
| Ledger head start (5 rows from 08-09) | worked | **2 of 5 real.** Three were already ingested by other routines; see Headline 1 |
| `find-new-kiriakou-videos.mjs` baseline | worked | 154 videos, 6 searches, **0 new. Sixth consecutive dry run** |
| **SoundCloud** (platform never opened) | worked | **The seam of the day** — 160 items, 3 new shows ingested, audio fetchable |
| **Apple `entity=podcastEpisode`** (endpoint never used) | worked | **159 episodes, 6 new ≥40m ingested + ~12 parked.** Supersedes the "iTunes is exhausted" finding |
| **Internet Archive** advanced search | worked | Surfaced three leads, **all three of which died on inspection** (see Rejected). Its real value today was negative: it proved C-SPAN is held behind `access-restricted-item` |
| Internet Archive — `community_media` | worked | Only *Foresight with Ken Weaver*, already held. Thin collection |
| Internet Archive — `radio4all_net` | worked | 5 items, **0 new** — Global Research News Hour repeats and one TUC Radio. **Low-yield, deprioritise** |
| Internet Archive — misspellings (`kiriako`, `kyriakou`, `kiriakos`) | worked | **Pure noise** — Greek DJs, a pianist named Rena Kyriakou. **Dead end, do not re-run** |
| **Mixcloud round 2** | worked | Confirms 08-09 exactly: metadata resolves, stream 404s. **Still an index only.** Loud & Clear ×3 stay blocked |
| **Scott Horton feed enumeration** | worked | His site lists **15** Kiriakou interviews; the corpus holds all 15. **Exhausted — do not re-run** |
| **Transcript mining for show names** | worked | Surfaced repeat Piers Morgan appearances (he says "I was on the Piers Morgan show" three separate times) — but they are **panel debates** with Dershowitz/Posobiec, so they fail the attribution bar |
| C-SPAN direct | attempted | **CloudFront 403 to a plain fetch *and* to a real browser.** Harder than the 08-09 note suggested. The Archive's copies are access-restricted and their caption `.srt`s download as 0 bytes |
| Homebrewed Culture Cast | attempted | **08-09's diagnosis was wrong.** Not an ffmpeg failure — the URL 404s because `%20`s were stripped from the filename. No surviving feed located |

### Ingested and written

| # | Show | Date | Len | Path in | What it added |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **David Gornoski** (A Neighbor's Choice) | 2019-10-15 | 41m | Apple episode index → libsyn | The **Melber walkout** — he took his microphone off mid-taping after being introduced as a leaker and a convicted felon, on a panel about whistleblowing with Ellsberg.

### Rejected — and three of the four survived a show-and-date check

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| **Citizen Radio 2010-01-30 (60m)** | **Kiriakou is not a guest.** The hosts discuss a news story about him and mispronounce his name throughout. The Archive description named him, which is what fooled the vetting. Fifth instance of this failure mode |
| **Podcast UFO 2025-03-26 (61m)** | **79.1% overlap** with corpus `2025-03-26-podcast-ufo-live-shows` — the same show under a second feed name. Transcribed before the check; see the matcher bug below |
| **Abe Lincoln's Top Hat 572 (93m)** | **90.9% overlap** with a copy already ingested on 08-07 from the Simplecast feed. The Internet Archive copy carries a different URL and slug, so a URL dedupe misses it |
| **Austin and Matt #04 (91m)** | The podbean enclosure Apple returns **404s**. Not reachable |
| Consortium News *CN LIVE!* S3E5, American Exception ep. 2 | Multi-guest panels — attribution unsafe without speaker labels |
| Challenging Opinions 49/50, Talk Nation Radio, *Kiriakou 5PM* | 18–29 minutes; under the bar |
| 9 | **Clearing the FOG** | 2020-08-24 | 60m | Apple episode index (pre-2021 pass) → libsyn | **The regime change approval process** end to end — a memo written at the officer's own desk, cleared by the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel and the NSC's attorneys, signed by the president as an executive order, and left in a safe on the seventh floor because it cannot be destroyed but almost nobody may read it |

**New articles (6):** `the-melber-walkout`, `the-2016-research-pitch`, `the-grand-mosque-cover-story`,
`plato-kacheris`, `the-regime-change-approval-process`, and the substantial rebuild of
`the-rebuttal-book` from a 422-word stub. **Woven enrichments across 14 further articles**,
including one duplicated section collapsed in `gina-haspel` and two variances deliberately
preserved rather than smoothed (the FOIA page counts, and the year Brennan was fired).

### The count, plainly: nine, not ten

Nine sources were found, vetted, transcribed and written into the encyclopedia. The tenth was
attempted five times and each attempt died for a different reason — a guest who turned out not
to be a guest, two duplicates that only a shingle check caught, a dead enclosure URL, and a
403 on both available routes to the 2015 *Unauthorized Disclosure*. The angles in §2 were worked
and three new ones were invented (SoundCloud, Apple's episode endpoint, the pre-2021 term
sweep); the shortfall is one source, not a dry well, and the queue below is longer than it was
this morning.

### The matcher bug that cost a transcription

The show-name diff used to filter Apple results dropped words of three characters or fewer and
stopworded `podcast` and `show`. For a show called **"Podcast UFO"** that leaves an *empty*
token set, so it matched nothing and every episode read as new. Sixty-one minutes were
transcribed before `dupe-check.mjs` reported **79.1%** against a copy already held under the
show's other feed name.

**The generalisation is worth more than the fix:** the same interview is routinely published
under two different show names. Confirmed pairs today — Podcast UFO / *Podcast UFO Live Shows*;
History Told Forward / *Barracks Media*; My Price Is My Life / *O'Keefe Media Group*;
Borderland: Narcosis / *IRONCLAD*. Show-name matching therefore cannot be trusted at all.
**Run `node tools/dupe-check.mjs <slug>` on every transcript before writing a word of it** —
it is cheap, and today it caught two duplicates that had already survived a show-and-date check.

### For the next dig — the head start

1. **Unauthorized Disclosure, 2015-03-01 (61m)** — Gosztola and Khalek, weeks after his release,
   and the corpus holds nothing from that show before 2023. Both known routes 403: the anchor.fm
   player URL and the signed CloudFront enclosure behind it. Needs a different feed or a browser.
2. **Around The Empire ep. 6, 2017-01-25 (66m)** — "Inside The CIA's War With Trump." The corpus
   holds an untitled *Around The Empire* row at 2017-02-13; confirm whether that is this episode
   before spending a transcription on it.
3. **One Tough Podcast with Bo Dietl ep. 76, 2019-12-23 (48m)** — WABC; no corpus row anywhere
   near that date. Enclosure resolves.
4. **Jackman Radio, 2015-04-07 (71m)** — matched on description only, title does not name him.
   Vet before queueing.
5. **The ~12 parked 2025–26 shows in `KIRIAKOU-OPEN-VIDS.md`** are a **7am-intake problem**, not
   an archaeology one. Several proved to be syndication duplicates; the rest are worth a pass by
   whoever owns the daily routine.
6. Still blocked, unchanged: Loud & Clear ×3 (Mixcloud-only, download-protected), Homebrewed
   Culture Cast (404, filename mangled), C-SPAN (CloudFront 403 to fetch and browser alike),
   Alternative Radio KIRJ001 (paywalled).

**Method note for the next dig.** Discovery was not the bottleneck and has not been for four
digs; neither was transcription, once the lanes were serialised. **Dedupe was.** Four of this
run's thirteen fetched items were duplicates or false positives, and every one of them had
already passed a show-and-date check. Build the corpus index first, then diff on date and title,
then shingle-check the transcript — in that order — before any of it reaches an article.

## 2026-08-13 — a dig defeated by its own exclusion set

### The count, plainly: zero

Six sources were found, vetted as genuine long-form solo interviews, and **five of them were
fetched and fully transcribed** before the dedupe caught them. Every one was already in
`src/content/sources/`. Nothing new reached the encyclopedia; nothing was written; the corpus
stands where it stood this morning at 886 sources.

This was not a dry well. It was a **broken exclusion set**, and the failure is worth more than
the sources would have been.

### Headline 1: on this volume, `ls` and `git` disagree — and the gap *was* the candidate list

The dig opened, as instructed, by building an exclusion index from every source's frontmatter.
It built that index by walking `src/content/sources/*.md` **on disk**. The disk held **881**
sources. `git ls-tree -r HEAD` held **886**.

Those five missing files were not noise. They were:

| Source | Committed by | Found "new" at |
|---|---|---|
| Peter B. Collins Show 2017-05-19 | `2441336f` corpus-mining, **today** | via Exa, ~40 min in |
| Whistleblower of the Week 2026-05-05 | `2441336f` corpus-mining, **today** | via Apple episode index |
| Green Socialist Notes 2021-05-13 | `2441336f` corpus-mining, **today** | via Apple episode index |
| Joannes Wyckmans 2026-06-16 | `1b74a975` source-squeeze, **today** | via Apple episode index |
| One Tough Podcast (Bo Dietl) ep. 76 2019-12-23 | earlier | via the Spreaker feed, first find of the day |

The EOS_DIGITAL volume drops committed files from disk under load — a known, logged hazard. The
consequence here is specific and severe: **the exclusion set and the intake guard both test the
disk**, so a dropped file is simultaneously invisible to dedupe *and* re-ingestible.
`ingest-audio-url.sh` guards with `[ -e "$OUT" ]`; that guard cannot see a file git knows about.
Five re-transcriptions followed, roughly ninety minutes of CPU on a machine that had none spare.

Nothing was damaged: faster-whisper's greedy decode is deterministic, so every re-transcription
came back byte-identical and `git status` reported the tree clean afterwards. That is luck, not
design — a source whose committed copy came from YouTube captions would have been silently
overwritten with a whisper transcript.

**The 08-12 dig hit this same volume behaviour and wrote down "never `ls` alone on this volume."
It recurred today anyway, because the index was still built by globbing the directory.** So,
concretely, for whoever digs next:

```bash
git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only | grep '^src/content/sources/.*\.md$' | grep -v '\.sponsors\.md$'
```

Build the `date ⇥ show ⇥ title` index from **that** list, not from a glob. Then diff on show+date,
then shingle-check. In that order.

### Headline 2: the dup threshold is wrong across transcript types

Bo Dietl episode 76 scored **70.8%** on `dupe-check.mjs` against
`2025-06-06-red-apple-podcast-network` — which is the *same episode*, same title
("Episode 76-John Kiriakou"), same 48:00 duration, same 89 paragraphs, re-uploaded to YouTube
under Dietl's network name.

Previous digs treated ~79% and ~91% as the dup line. **A conversation transcribed twice by
different means does not reach that line.** The held copy came from YouTube auto-captions; this
one from whisper. Different segmentation, different ad reads, different disfluency handling —
same conversation, 71%.

**Treat anything above ~65% as a dup until proven otherwise, and read the first paragraph of the
match before deciding.** Bo Dietl also demonstrates the double-filing trap in its purest form:
the corpus holds it under the *network's* name at the *re-upload* date, so no show+date diff
could ever have caught it.

### Headline 3: Exa is a genuinely new and productive seam — the corpus just got there first

No previous dig had used **Exa** (semantic search, key already in the registry under
`kiripedia`). Two of its modes earned their place:

- **`/search` with date windows** surfaced the Peter B. Collins Show — a long-running interview
  programme that no ledger, no feed sweep and no YouTube pass had ever named.
- **`/findSimilar` on a known-good interview page** was the single highest-yield query of the
  day. Seeding it with one Kiriakou interview page returned KBOO, Tell Somebody, Project
  Censored, Free Man Beyond the Wall, Whistleblower of the Week and the Jason Jones back
  catalogue — a traversal that keyword search does not perform.

The method is sound and should be repeated. It simply arrived after corpus-mining and
source-squeeze had already taken the same material *the same morning*.

### Headline 4: "named in the show notes, not in the room" is now the dominant false positive

**Nine instances in one dig**, up from a running count of five:

| Rejected | Who was actually the guest |
|---|---|
| Project Censored Show 2015-07-12 | Jesselyn Radack, naming him as a client |
| Danny Jones #390 2026-04-24 (163m) | Julian Dorey |
| Matthew Cox 2026-04-28 (174m) | an FBI agent discussing him |
| SaltCubeAnalytics 2026-03-19 | Sibel Edmonds |
| Unwashed and Unruly 2026-03-16 | hosts discussing the Epstein files |
| The Freedom Talking Show #101 | a news-roundup magazine show |
| Joannes Wyckmans ×3 (02-23, 02-24, 03-21) | matched the **show-level** blurb; only the 06-16 episode had him on |

Apple's `entity=podcastEpisode` matches **descriptions**, and cross-promo blocks in show notes
name guests from other episodes. **Read the episode description before queueing** — one Apple
lookup is far cheaper than the 163 and 174 minutes those two would have cost.

### Headline 5: this machine is swap-bound, and that dictates the shape of a dig

8 cores, 8 GB RAM, and **6.4 GB of 7.1 GB swap already in use** before the dig started. Three
concurrent whisper jobs pushed a 10-minute window from ~5 minutes to **~23 minutes**; dropping
back to a single serial lane returned it to ~11–16 minutes per episode. Load average peaked at
23.5 on 8 cores.

Concurrency does not buy throughput here — it costs it. **One transcription at a time**, and
budget roughly 15 minutes per hour of audio. A 136-minute episode (Jay's Analysis) was parked on
cost alone; it later proved to be a duplicate anyway.

### Angles worked

| Angle | Status | Yield |
|---|---|---|
| Ledger head start (08-12's queue of 5) | worked | **All stale.** Potkaars, AM WakeUp and Health Ranger were already ingested; the Scheer rows too |
| `find-new-kiriakou-videos.mjs` baseline | worked | 145 videos, 1 survivor — today's own-show upload. **Seventh consecutive dry run** |
| **Exa `/search`, date-windowed** | worked | **New tool.** Surfaced Peter B. Collins, the 2010 WMLB radio file, the 2020 TAC and Quinones leads |
| **Exa `/findSimilar` from a seed interview page** | worked | **Highest-yield query of the dig** — 6 shows the corpus had never been searched against |
| Apple `entity=podcastEpisode`, fresh vocabulary | worked | ~30 distinct ≥40m episodes; after a correct git diff, **0 genuinely absent** |
| **Co-guest traversal** (McGovern, Radack, Drake, Ellsberg, Rowley) | worked | 152 shows ranked by co-guest overlap → Project Censored, Tell Somebody, Macroaggressions, SpyCast, Media Roots. **All either absent of him, held, or under length** |
| **Wayback Machine for dead show sites** | worked | **New angle, and it works** — recovered the exact Quinones ep. 388 enclosure and the TAC libsyn embed id from pages that 403 or 404 live. Both hosts have since died, so neither is fetchable |
| Transcript mining for show names | worked | **Nothing.** The "I was on X" regex over-matches third-party chatter (Hannity, Piers Morgan) that is discussion *about* him |
| Internet Archive `mediatype:audio` | worked | **American Exception roundtables and his own RT show only.** Confirms 08-12 — deprioritise |
| Feed enumeration (Scheer, Horton, Free Man, Homebrewed, WhoWhatWhy, Project Censored) | worked | WhoWhatWhy has 4 episodes, **all 14–28 min**. Homebrewed 404s on every URL encoding tried |
| C-SPAN, Alternative Radio, Mixcloud | not attempted | Blocked in three prior digs; nothing changed |

### Rejected on the merits (beyond the nine false positives above)

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| **Around The Empire ep. 6, 2017-01-25 (66m)** | The corpus's `2017-02-13` row *is* this episode — its own intro says "January eighteen to twenty seventeen". Caught before transcription; the 08-12 log flagged exactly this and the check paid off |
| Jason Jones 2026-06-11 (167m) and 2026-03-23 (83m) | Held under their **YouTube upload dates** (06-15, 03-20). The feed-vs-upload divergence again; **167 minutes saved** |
| Scheer Intelligence 2021-09-10 (63m) | Held as `2022-05-19-scheerpost` — "Kiriakou Interview 9/10/21", filed at the re-post date |
| News Beat 2024-07-31 (47m) | Held at `2024-07-29` |
| Cleared Hot 2026-05-04 (200m) | Held; "Cleared Hot - Powered By BRCC" vs "Cleared Hot Podcast" defeated the show-name matcher |
| Peter B. Collins 2017-06-30 / 2021 archive re-runs | Kiriakou **with Joseph Hickman** — two guests, attribution unsafe without speaker labels |
| KBOO 2017-04-21 (30m) and 2016-05-24 (60m) | Under the bar; the 60m is an *Alternative Radio* slot with no fetchable audio on the page |
| Julian Dorey Daily ×3 (64m each) | The "Daily" clip feed — explicit playbook reject |
| Free Speech TV `aOh_qukB5cQ` | 10 minutes |
| `_T7J-jzEo9Q` (46m, today) | **His own show, Ep. 10** — and a 7am-intake item, not archaeology |

### For the next dig — the head start

1. **Fix the index first.** Build the exclusion set from `git ls-tree`, per Headline 1. Until that
   changes, every dig on this volume is at risk of re-finding what it already owns.
2. **Lower the `dupe-check.mjs` line to ~65%** and always eyeball the top match.
3. **Free Man Beyond the Wall ep. 388 (2017-06-13)** — verified absent from git. Filename known;
   libsyn account dead; needs a third host (podcast archive mirrors, or the Steemit/Hive mirror's
   own copy).
4. **TAC *Empire Has No Clothes* ep. 4 (2020-05-28)** — verified absent. libsyn embed id 14593364,
   now 500ing. 2020 holds only 19 sources and is the thinnest post-prison year.
5. **Re-run Exa `/findSimilar` from three or four different seed pages** — one seed produced six
   new shows; the method is nowhere near exhausted, it was simply beaten to the material today.
6. **Coordinate with corpus-mining and source-squeeze.** Both committed Kiriakou sources *the
   same morning* this dig ran, and neither touches `KIRIAKOU-OPEN-VIDS.md` or this log. The
   archaeology routine is now routinely digging up what another routine ingested hours earlier.
   That is the single largest source of wasted effort in this run, and it is organisational,
   not technical.

**Method note.** Discovery was not the bottleneck (four digs running). Transcription was not the
bottleneck (serial whisper is ~15 min/hour of audio). **Dedupe was the bottleneck, again, and for
the third dig running — but this time it failed at the source, on an index that could not see
five of the corpus's own files.** Fix the index and this dig's six candidates become tomorrow's
first honest zero.
